Project Title: Student Record Management System
📝 Description:
The Student Record Management System is a console-based C++ application designed to manage basic student data using file handling techniques. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records stored in a binary file (students.dat).
This project is useful for learning file I/O in C++, working with classes and objects, and understanding how to persist data between program executions.

🎯 Key Features:
Add Student Record
Users can enter student details such as Roll Number, Name, and Marks.
The record is saved in a binary file using ofstream.
Display All Records
Displays all student records in a formatted table.
Uses ifstream to read from the binary file.
Search Student by Roll Number
Users can enter a roll number to search for a specific student.
Displays the record if found.
Delete Student Record
Deletes a student’s record based on roll number.
Temporary file technique is used to recreate the file without the deleted record.

⚙️ Technologies Used:
Language: C++
Concepts: OOP (Classes and Objects), File Handling (Binary files), Console I/O
Platform: Windows/Linux console

📦 Benefits and Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on experience with binary file handling in C++
Understanding of object-oriented design (encapsulation)
Learn how to build menu-driven CLI applications
Practical application of basic data management concepts
